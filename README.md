## Project 1: Titanic Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### 📊 Project Overview
This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to understand how demographic and socio-economic factors influenced passenger survival. The analysis focuses on gender, passenger class, and age groups using visual and statistical techniques.

---

### 🔍 Key Analysis Performed
- Inspected missing values and data types
- Analyzed survival rates by gender, passenger class, and age buckets
- Visualized results using bar charts, boxplots, and violin plots
- Interpreted survival patterns and trends

---

### 📈 Key Insights
- Female passengers had a significantly higher survival rate compared to males.
- First-class passengers were more likely to survive than second- and third-class passengers.
- Children had the highest survival rate, while senior passengers had the lowest.
- Survivors were generally younger, though age alone was not a decisive factor.

### 🏁 Conclusion
The Titanic dataset EDA clearly demonstrates that survival during the disaster was not random but strongly influenced by structured social and demographic factors. Gender emerged as the most significant determinant of survival, followed closely by passenger class, while age played a secondary yet important role. The analysis confirms that women and children were prioritized during evacuation, and passengers from higher socio-economic classes benefited from better access to safety measures.

This project highlights the importance of exploratory data analysis in uncovering real-world patterns and biases hidden within data. Through effective use of visualizations, the analysis transformed raw data into meaningful insights that explain human behavior, policy decisions, and structural inequalities during crisis situations. Overall, this EDA provides a strong foundation for predictive modeling and reinforces the value of data-driven reasoning in understanding historical events.
